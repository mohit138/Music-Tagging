This repository contains the work done on Music Tagging Data Set. Data is studied with various approaches and Neural Networks are used to solve the Problemn. Everything is implemented from scratch in python. 
Many packages and libraries are used to get a better understanding and intuition for the problemn.(like, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, etc.)

**For Better understanding, the following files have the best approaches and results :**
* UnderstandingData.ipynb
* DeepNN.ipynb
* revisedNN2l.ipynb
